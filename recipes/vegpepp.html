            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This vegetarian stuffed peppers recipe is not too spicy, but it is packed with flavor. My kids loved it! For variety, add corn or other vegetables, or switch to other canned tomato varieties. Follow the boiling method prior to baking if you don't want a crispy bell pepper. If you have small peppers, use more of them for this recipe. They taste great with a dollop of sour cream on top.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Mexican cheese blend (such as Sargento® Authentic Mexican)</li>
